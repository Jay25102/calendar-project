Personal project that generates a calendar

# Version 0.5
- Creates a calendar based on the browser's time zone
- Works with Firefox
- Unorganized code
- Needs refactoring and more efficient time complexity
- No CSS currently
- Time does not update if the day transitions, only on refresh

## Todo
- Refactoring
- ~~Organize the Frankensteins monster function into multiple functions~~
- Basic CSS
- Allow the user to click on a date to add notes/events
- Save those events in the browser
- ~~Highlight current day~~
